Still working on Qthread Skeleton
	-Communication between threads is working
	-Need to implement all AFM methods in serialworker class
	-Need to rethink how to communicate. Protected buffer should be easiest.
		-Current strategy is:
			1)From main thread call requestMethod(method)
			2)Worker then uses switch case to then call appropriate method
			3)Method then passes arguments to afm.c class which initiates afm code.
				-Should we move the whole afm.c code to the serialWorker class?
				-Communication between threads should be protected. How?
	-Question: should all afm code be done in seperate thread?

Fixed Debugging issue
	-There was an error where a null value was being accessed when no COM ports were available
	-Added a check to remove the error.
