	- Looks nice

	
	
**************************
1. BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
**************************
Before you start make sure you have the mingw-32 compiler installed
and at least version 5.3.2 of Qt Creator

1. Download and install qwt-6.1.1

2. Download and install qwtplot3d-0.3.1-322

3. Update the nano-i.pro project file with the required file paths

4. Run qmake and build the application and you should be good to go

**************************
2. CORE COMPONENTS
**************************

The main application is divided into 4 threads
	1.GUI thread
	2.Sender thread
	3.Receiver thread
	4.Continuous event thread 
	
The threads communicate by way of 3 buffers
	1.Command buffer
		The Command buffer can only be written to by the GUI thread
		When the user performs an action the GUI pushes to this buffer to request
		That the Sender thread communicates with the MCU
		
	2.Receive buffer
		The Receive buffer is written to by the Sender thread. When the sender receives a 
		request for a command it pushes to the receive buffer to notify the receiver thread
		that there will be bytes to be read.
		
	3.Return buffer
		The return buffer is written to by the receiver thread. When the receiver receives a
		notification to read the serial port it will place the data it reads into the 
		return buffer and then the GUI reads the return buffer.

	4.Event thread
		The event thread write to the command buffer when we want to update graphs. This thread
		should handle all graph updating so that the main thread isn't required to spend 
		resources updating the graphs
